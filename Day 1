üîç What Exactly Happened?
1Ô∏è‚É£ Copying the WAR File
* You built the project in Jenkins, which generated the EcommerceApp.war file.
* We copied the WAR file from Jenkins to Tomcat's webapps/ folder, where Tomcat looks for applications.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Extracting the WAR File
* Normally, Tomcat automatically extracts WAR files into a folder when it starts.
* In this case, it didn't extract it, so we did it manually using:‚Ä®bash‚Ä®CopyEdit‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Ä®sudo unzip EcommerceApp.war -d EcommerceApp/‚Ä®
* This created a folder EcommerceApp/ inside webapps/ that contained all the necessary files.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Restarting Tomcat
* After extracting the WAR file, Tomcat needed to reload the application.
* We restarted Tomcat using:‚Ä®bash‚Ä®CopyEdit‚Ä®sudo ./catalina.sh stop
* sudo ./catalina.sh start
* This forced Tomcat to detect the extracted files and deploy the app.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Accessing the App
* Once Tomcat deployed the application, we accessed it at:‚Ä®arduino‚Ä®CopyEdit‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Ä®http://localhost:8080/EcommerceApp/‚Ä®
* Now the application is running correctly! üéâ
