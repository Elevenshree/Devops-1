Session 4: Docker & Microservices
Docker Basics

OS-level virtualization

Enables platform-independent, portable apps

Each microservice has its own Dockerfile, image, container

Monolithic vs Microservices

Monolithic: Single-tier app; tightly coupled; single point of failure

Microservices: Independently deployable services; loosely coupled

Advantages:

Fault isolation

Scalability

“Build Once, Run Anywhere”
